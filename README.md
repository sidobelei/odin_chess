# chess

This project's purpose was to create a game on the command line. Two human players can play Chess against each other.

The main focus was to work more with object-orientated programming and test-driven development on a larger and more complex project.


## Instructions:
- When it is your turn to make a move, type in the starting position of your piece, comma, then the new location.
    - Example: "a2, a3"
- To save a game just type in "save" and follow the prompts.
- At the beginning of each new game, you can load any previous saves by following the prompts.
- When there's an opportunity to make an en passant move the new location input of your pawn should be where it ends up
- Castling:
    - For castling on the queen side the new location input is "0-0-0"
    - For castling on the king side the new location input is "0-0"
    - For promoting pawns follow the prompts that appear after you've reached the opponent's back rank
- Have fun!
